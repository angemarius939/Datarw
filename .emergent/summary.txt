<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully expanded the DataRW application from an MVP, integrating a FastAPI backend with MongoDB and moving from mock data to real API interactions. Key developments included comprehensive authentication, replacing Stripe with IremboPay, and implementing an AI-powered survey generation module. Subsequently, significant effort was dedicated to building out a robust project management system, including project, activity, budget, KPI, and beneficiary tracking. The recent work focused on fully functionalizing the Admin Panel for user and partner management, and integrating a mock IremboPay service. The engineer adeptly handled frontend UI updates, backend API extensions, model definitions, and critical bug fixes related to authentication token handling and data aggregation. The current task transitions to enhancing reporting with AI and developing an iOS app.

<product_requirements>
The DataRW web application serves as a comprehensive platform for data collection, analysis, and management, targeting organizations for surveys, M&E, and research. It supports online payments, survey creation, data/user management, KPI tracking, and data export, ensuring isolated organizational data with role-based access (Admin, Editor, Viewer). The pricing model is usage-based (data storage, entity creation).

The current implementation features a React frontend with a responsive landing page detailing Basic, Professional, and Enterprise tiers. The multi-tab dashboard includes overview, surveys, survey builder, data management, and user management. The interactive survey builder supports diverse question types. A FastAPI backend with MongoDB handles CRUD operations, user authentication, and enumerator management, with IremboPay replacing Stripe. A React Native Android mobile app offers offline data collection.

Recent enhancements include improved text handling in surveys, AI-powered survey generation (from prompts/documents), and Kinyarwanda translation. A new DataRW Projects module centralizes project data, M&E, activity/budget tracking, KPI dashboards, secure document storage, and beneficiary profiling. Upcoming features include filters, organization logos, partner performance tracking, an advanced admin panel, and an iOS app.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture:** React, FastAPI, MongoDB.
-   **API Design:** RESTful, JWT authentication,  prefix.
-   **Payment Gateway:** IremboPay integration (mocked currently).
-   **Mobile Development:** React Native (Android, planned iOS).
-   **AI Integration:** LLMs via  for survey generation and narrative reporting.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application employs a standard full-stack setup: React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB as the database. Services are orchestrated by Supervisor, with Kubernetes managing ingress rulesâ€” routes direct to backend (port 8001), others to frontend (port 3000).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on implementing advanced enterprise features, specifically for the DataRW Projects module and subsequent enhancements.

The previous critical bug where project management functionalities (like Create New Project, Add Activity, Add Beneficiary, Add KPI) were reported as not working in all menus has been fully resolved by:
1.  Creating and integrating new frontend modals (, , , ) to make static quick action buttons functional.
2.  Fixing critical authentication token handling issues in  that prevented backend project APIs from being called correctly.
3.  Verifying all project management backend APIs were operational.

Subsequently, the AI engineer completed the following:
*   **Admin Panel Implementation (Phase 1):**
    *   Replaced the incomplete  with a comprehensive version.
    *   Added new admin and partner management API functions to .
    *   Integrated the  into the  sidebar and main content area.
    *   Fixed a  error in 's  function.
    *   Successfully created a new admin user via backend for testing purposes and verified the Admin Panel's functionality, including dashboard statistics and user management, through frontend screenshots.
*   **IremboPay Integration (Mock/Demo, Phase 2A):**
    *   Obtained the IremboPay integration playbook.
    *   Implemented a mock version of the IremboPay payment service (), updated  with payment-related schemas, and integrated mock payment endpoints into .
    *   Added payment-related API functions to  and updated  to use the mock service.
    *   Successfully tested the mock IremboPay integration on the backend.
*   **AI-Enhanced Automated Reporting (Phase 2B - In Progress):**
    *   Began implementing the enhanced reporting feature.
    *   Created  and integrated its endpoints into .
    *   Added reporting API functions to .
    *   Created  and updated  to use it.

The system is currently in a state where the core DataRW Projects module, the Admin Panel, and a mock IremboPay integration are functional. The AI-enhanced reporting feature is actively being developed.
