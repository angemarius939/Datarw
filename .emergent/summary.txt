<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built the DataRW platform, starting with a React frontend using mock data to quickly demonstrate features like a landing page, dashboard, survey builder, and user management. Upon user approval, backend development commenced, integrating FastAPI and MongoDB for data persistence, authentication, and initial Stripe payment integration (later replaced by IremboPay). Key technical issues, such as import errors and bcrypt attribute errors, were identified and resolved through iterative testing. A significant focus was placed on refining the frontend's interaction with the backend, removing mock data, and improving error handling. The AI also addressed branding updates and, critically, developed a React Native mobile application with offline capabilities, resolving a critical download functionality bug. The current focus is on validating the end-to-end survey creation flow on the frontend after extensive backend and  component updates.

<product_requirements>
The DataRW web application is designed to collect, analyze, and manage data for surveys, monitoring, evaluation, and research. It caters to organizations, allowing them to pay online for access to a platform that provides tools for setting up survey questionnaires and forms, data management, KPI tracking, dashboards, and data export. Each organization will have isolated data and an admin panel to manage user access levels (Admin, Editor, Viewer) within their own tenant. The payment model is based on data storage and the number of surveys or information management entities created. A public-facing landing page is also required.

**Current Implementation Details:**
*   **Frontend:** Built with React, featuring a modern/minimal, corporate, and colorful design with micro-animations. Includes a responsive landing page with pricing tiers (Basic: 100K FRW, Professional: 300K FRW, Enterprise: Custom), a multi-tab dashboard (overview, surveys, survey builder, data management, user management), and an interactive survey builder supporting various question types (multiple choice, text, rating, file upload, calculations, skip logic). User management includes role-based access control.
*   **Backend:** Developed with FastAPI, using MongoDB for data storage. It includes essential CRUD endpoints, user authentication (registration, login), and enumerator management for survey assignments.
*   **Payment Gateway:** Initially planned with Stripe, it has been replaced with IremboPay based on user's specific request and provided documentation. The system is designed to handle custom amounts or fixed price products, create payment transactions, and poll for status updates. IremboPay API keys are pending.
*   **Mobile Application:** A React Native Android mobile application has been developed, designed to work both online and offline, with data synchronization capabilities. It supports enumerator login, survey assignment (per ID), and data collection. Download links are integrated into the landing page.
*   **Branding:** The application features DataRW branding, with the footer dynamically updating the current year and attributing the work to Research Analytics and AI Solutions Ltd.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving issues related to survey creation.
1.  **Survey Creation Bug Fix:** The user reported a  when trying to create a new survey. The AI identified that the  icon from  was being used in  but was not correctly imported. This import was fixed.
2.  **SurveyBuilder Backend Integration:** Following the icon fix, it was noted that  was still relying on mock data. The AI has updated this component to now interact with the real backend API for survey creation. This involved modifying the component to handle state, API calls, and form submissions for creating new surveys and questions, including handling loading states and displaying error messages for form fields like title and description.
3.  **Backend Testing Confirmation:** The backend's survey creation endpoint has been successfully tested and confirmed to be working correctly, ensuring that the API side is ready for frontend integration.

The system is currently in a state where the  component on the frontend has been modified to interact with the backend, and the backend survey creation functionality is validated. The last action taken was fixing  and verifying backend behavior.
