The previous AI engineer successfully brought the DataRW application from its MVP stage, initially focusing on a React frontend with mock data, then integrating a FastAPI backend and MongoDB. A significant part of the work involved transitioning from mock data to real API integration, including authentication and replacing Stripe with IremboPay. The trajectory highlights iterative bug fixing, such as resolving  import errors and  issues. Subsequently, the AI engineer implemented advanced features like AI-powered survey generation, enhanced text handling for survey questions, and a fully-fledged project management module. Key challenges addressed were authentication flow between frontend and backend, ensuring correct token handling, and transforming static UI elements into functional components with associated modals and backend APIs. The work involved extensive file modifications across frontend components, backend models, services, and API endpoints, demonstrating a strong grasp of full-stack development.

<product_requirements>
The DataRW web application is designed as a comprehensive platform for data collection, analysis, and management in surveys, monitoring, evaluation, and research, primarily for organizations. It supports online payments, provides tools for survey creation, data management, KPI tracking, dashboards, and data export, ensuring isolated data per organization with role-based user management (Admin, Editor, Viewer). The payment model is based on data storage and entity creation. A public landing page showcases features and pricing.

The application currently features a React frontend with a modern design, including a responsive landing page with pricing tiers (Basic: 100K FRW, Professional: 300K FRW, Enterprise: Custom), a multi-tab dashboard (overview, surveys, survey builder, data management, user management), and an interactive survey builder supporting diverse question types. The FastAPI backend with MongoDB handles CRUD operations, user authentication, and enumerator management. IremboPay replaced Stripe for payment processing. A React Native mobile app with offline capabilities supports enumerator login and data collection, with download links on the landing page.

Recent additions include enhanced text handling for survey questions (longer text, validation), AI-powered survey generation (from prompts or uploaded documents), and automatic translation into Kinyarwanda. A new DataRW Projects module has been integrated, centralizing project data, M&E processes, activity tracking, budgeting, action plans, KPI dashboards, secure document storage, and beneficiary profiling. Future requirements include filters, organization logos, partner performance tracking, and an advanced admin panel for user and access level management.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on implementing advanced enterprise features for the newly introduced DataRW Projects module, following user confirmation. The previous critical bug where project management functionalities (like Create New Project, Add Activity, Add Beneficiary, Add KPI) were reported as not working in all menus has been fully resolved. It was identified that these buttons were static placeholders lacking backend integration.

The AI engineer successfully:
1.  **Created multiple new frontend modals**: , , , and  to provide functional forms for project-related entity creation.
2.  **Integrated these modals**: Made the static quick action buttons in  and  functional, linking them to the newly created modals.
3.  **Fixed authentication issues**: A critical bug related to the frontend not properly passing the authentication token to backend project endpoints was identified and resolved by ensuring consistent token handling from  to API calls. An issue with  import in  was also fixed.
4.  **Verified backend endpoints**: All project management backend APIs (, , , , , ) were thoroughly tested and confirmed to be fully operational and returning correct data.
5.  **Enhanced backend models and services**: Added comprehensive models () and created a new  to support future advanced admin panel features. New admin endpoints were also added to .

The system is currently in a state where the core DataRW Projects module, including creation of projects, activities, KPIs, beneficiaries, and budget items, is fully functional on both frontend and backend. The most recent action was creating the  and adding related endpoints to , in preparation for building the Admin Panel frontend component.
