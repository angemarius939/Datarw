# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: true
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0

## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

          comment: "ENHANCED ACTIVITY CREATION TESTING COMPLETED WITH MIXED RESULTS (57% success rate): Tested CreateActivityModal refactor with milestones, planned/actual outputs, and assigned person dropdown. WORKING ENDPOINTS: ✅ GET /api/users - Returns user list with required fields (id, name, email) for assigned person dropdown, ✅ POST /api/projects - Creates minimal project successfully for activity linking, ✅ POST /api/activities - Enhanced activity creation working with all required fields: milestones array with name/planned_date, planned_output/target_quantity, actual_output/achieved_quantity, auto-stamped last_updated_by, planned dates fallback, progress defaults (0%), completion/schedule variance defaults, ✅ Edge cases handled correctly - empty milestones array accepted, ISO date parsing working, no ObjectId serialization issues. CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED: ❌ GET /api/activities - Returns validation errors for existing activities missing new required fields (planned_start_date, planned_end_date, last_updated_by), ❌ PUT /api/activities/{activity_id}/progress - Returns HTTP 500 due to ObjectId validation error (backend expects MongoDB ObjectId but receives UUID string), ❌ GET /api/activities/{activity_id}/variance - Returns HTTP 500 due to same ObjectId/UUID mismatch issue. ROOT CAUSE: Enhanced Activity model requires new fields that existing database records don't have, and UUID/ObjectId type mismatch in progress/variance endpoints. Enhanced activity creation works perfectly but compatibility with existing data and progress tracking needs fixes."

Root cause analysis reveals: 1) Frontend field names don't match backend ProjectCreate model (title→name, total_budget→budget_total, etc.), 2) Missing required project_manager_id field, 3) Frontend error handling attempts to render Pydantic validation error objects directly as React children instead of extracting error messages.
